# Supported browsers

## Our stated goal:

We support the current version of the browser, plus the previous major release of the browser.

## Potential issues:

* We are using webGL, which has limited support in IE 10, firefox, and the Android browser.
* We are using typed arrays, which does not have support for Uint8ClampedArray in IE 10 and IE Mobile 10/11.
* Canvas blend modes are not supported in IE.
* WebAudio is not supported in IE or the Android Browser.


As of August 2016, this means that we support:
